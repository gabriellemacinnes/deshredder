# De-shredder

Gabrielle Lavoie and Gabrielle MacInnes - COMP6841 Something Awesome Project

During the first week of COMP6841 lectures, the Professor gave us a bonus challenge. We were asked to piece back together a piece of shredded paper hiding a secret message. This challenge inspired our idea for the Something Awesome Project: What if we could create a web application that would allow us to upload pictures of shredded paper pieces to reconstruct the original secret document?
